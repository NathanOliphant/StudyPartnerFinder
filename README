--studygroups_day:
DELETE FROM studygroups_day;    
DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name = 'studygroups_day';

DELETE FROM studygroups_message;    
DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name = 'studygroups_message';

DELETE FROM auth_permission;    
DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name = 'auth_permission';
